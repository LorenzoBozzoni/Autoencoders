## Theoretical project for the Numerical Analysis for ML course @ PoliMi A.Y 2023-2024
This project involved explaining and studying the topic of Autoencoders.
In particular the starting paper from which develop the work is from [Baldi](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v27/baldi12a/baldi12a.pdf)
and focuses on linear and boolean autoencoders and the clustering complexity.  

If you want to have a look rapidly to the research content you can have a look at the slides while for a 
more in-depth explanation there is a 15-ish page long report with all the math you didn't ask for.
